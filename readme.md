# Challenge 02: CSS Portfolio - Due Nov 17, 2022

## Introduction

The purpose of this challenge was to familiarize me with building a website from scratch incorporating all of the skills we've obtained so far, specifically with the use of flex-box and media queries.

## Techniques Used

I employed the use of a multitude of CSS selectors, the useage of flex-box, and the use of media queries to design a responsive website that fulfills all requirements of the challenge.

## Examples of Use

The screen without utilizing media queries looks like the following:

<img src="assets/images/readme_screenshots/larss.jpg"/>

with all elements spread evenly accross the page. 

These boxes resize appropriately as the viewport changes. If the viewport is less than 1200px or greater than 768px, then the margins on the left side for a cleaner look:

<img src="assets/images/readme_screenshots/medss.jpg"/>

When the viewport shrinks to less than 768, then the structure of the page changes and the nav bar bumps down at the top, the picture boxes change shape to lay more neatly on a smaller viewport, the subheadings of "About me" "Projects" and "Contact Me" switch to a flex-row format to allow for more space for the other elements, and the nav bar at the bottom of the page lays more neatly:

<img src="assets/images/readme_screenshots/smass.jpg"/>

The entire design adjusts neatly to any viewport size as per the the parameters of the challenge.

The links exhibit a change in color when hovered, both in the nav bar as well as in the portion with the picture links as demonstrated here:

<img src="assets/images/readme_screenshots/hoverdemo.jpg"/>

All links work correctly as per the user-story, both locally and globally.
